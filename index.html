        <h3>Master of Arts in Mass Communication</h3>
        <h3>University of Florida</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My name is Margaret Pope. I graduated from the <a href="https://olemiss.edu/" target="_blank">University of Mississippi</a> in 2016 with a degree in history. Upon graduation, I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where I worked for a small organization called <a href="https://mbird.com/" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a> for three years. In late 2019, I moved back to my hometown, Birmingham, Alabama, where I work at the church I grew up attending. I tend to be the catch-all person at work, so my position includes a variety of responsibilities, including adminstrative assistant, social media management, and membership database maintenance.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I to visit with my friends and family. During the Covid lockdown, I picked up needlepoint and cross-stitch which continue to be favorite hobbies of mine. I started a stitch club to meet women my age who also enjoy needlework. I also like to travel, especially the planning and logistics side of traveling. My favorites places I have visited are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Israel</li>
            <li>Austin, TX</li>
            <li>Highlands, NC</li>
            <li>Carmel, CA</li>
        </ol>

        <p>My goal through this master's program is to consolidate my role into the communications department to delve more into social media and website management. I eventually want to become the Director of Communications, as well as freelance on the side. On a more personal level, I hope this program will further develop the passion I have for design and communications.</p>
